MovieMaven, a way to manage the way you watch movies

## Project Discription

this application is a easy way to manage what movies you want to watch. We have the newest movies so that you can keep up with the newest releases with their own discription pages with information like the release date and other information. We also focused on making the experience personalised with your own customisable profile, a watchlist etc.

We choose to work with next.js because of the features that we wanted to include in our project. it was a learning experience for us all because we didn't use next.js alot so we wanted to experiment with it. we also worked with supabase for logging in and for the profilepictures.

## How to set up the project

before you can get in the application you'll need to download next.js, here is the link https://nodejs.org/en/

after that you need to type in one of these commands, depending on which version you downloaded:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev 

## How to use the project

you need to make your own account so that you can use all of the features that we have prepared. the only things that we ask from you are your email and a password. after that you'll get a email from us confirming tha it was you who wanted to make a account. after you approved the email you can do what you want like making a watchlist for example
